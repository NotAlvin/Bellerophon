"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Redditors Think This Stock Will Go To The Moon","We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks.

FINRA Investor Education Foundation and CFA Institute (2023) revealed that ~37% of Gen-Z investors in the US and ~38% in the UK come to social media influencers regarding investment decisions. Therefore, it is important to explore the role finfluencers (influencers sharing financial advice on social media) play in providing investment information and how Gen-Z investors engage with finfluencers. Young investors are considering memes and viral videos as the primary source of investment advice.

Experts believe that retail or non-professional investors are now becoming dependent on digital channels, like social media platforms such as TikTok, when it comes to investing.

FINRA revealed that ~60% of US investors under age 35 believe that social media can be used as a source of investment information. This compares to ~57% who use finance professionals. This increase is probably because digital channels are becoming easily accessible, with ~60% of the global population utilizing social media (as per DataReportal).

Quick-scroll websites are now considered the go-to spot for investment ideas and inspiration. This is because of their bite-sized format and easy access. Ofcom, which tracks news consumption in the UK – revealed that TikTok’s reach for news went up from ~1% in 2020 to ~7% in 2022. This was mainly seen in younger folks aged between 16 – 24 years. Pew Research mentioned that, in the US, this increased from ~3% in 2020 to ~10% in 2022.

Financial advice content, which is shared on social media, has been contributing to the growth of the “creator economy,” which is pegged at ~$127 billion globally (as per Coherent Market Insights). This is expected to reach US$528.39 billion by 2030, with growth stemming from higher demand for user-generated content and increased monetization opportunities. Financial institutions and investment advisory companies are now focusing on creating pathways from social media to their product and services to exploit strong market opportunities. Therefore, most retail investors continue to make investing decisions under social media’s influence.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. highlighted that non-professional investors are now making a bigger part of the US options market as they continue to pour money mainly into short-term bets and technology stocks. The bank highlighted that retail traders accounted for ~18.3% of the total options activity in June. Social media and online investing communities have influenced retail investors to the extent that these investors don’t shy away from making investments in the downturn.

In late July and early August 2024, when there was a sharp decline in popular technology shares, retail investors turned out to be net buyers.

Vanda Research mentioned that individual investors, who were caught up in the market downturn, continued to be net buyers of shares of leading technology and AI-related companies. Just to balance out the risks, retail investors directed significant buying to an ETF tracking 20-Y Treasury bonds. Wall Street experts and enthusiasts believe that this confidence comes from the online investing communities and social media platforms, where there were discussions about going long on leading technology shares as they were trading at “decent levels.”

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) produces semiconductor products and devices. It provides products like microprocessors, embedded microprocessors, chipsets, graphics, and supplies them to third-party foundries. Also, it provides assembling, testing, and packaging services.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s recent CPU and GPU offerings appear to be more competitive with Intel’s and Nvidia’s products and it uses leading-edge process technologies. Its GPUs are highly sought after when it comes to cryptocurrency mining. With the improved outlook for blockchain technology, the company is well-positioned to take advantage. The company primarily benefits from intangible assets associated with its x86 instruction set architecture license, together with expertise in chip design.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) boasts a strong portfolio of Al data center products, ranging from accelerators to FPGAs. As a result of this portfolio, the company enjoys an ‘end-to-end Al platform.

In addition to the mentioned growth drivers, the company should significantly benefit from its recent acquisition. The company announced a definitive agreement to acquire ZT Systems for the consideration of $4.9 billion. This should help Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in enhancing its expertise in Al infrastructure systems and services.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s 2Q 2024 results were supported by healthy growth in the Data Center and Client segments. The company saw record data center segment revenue of $2.8 billion, exhibiting a rise of 115% YoY mainly because of the steep ramp of AMD Instinct™ GPU shipments, and strong growth in 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ CPU sales.

Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a “Buy” rating on the shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), setting a price target of $250.00 on 31st July.

Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a major global supplier of PC microprocessors and graphics processors to computing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The company’s product range spans desktops, notebooks, servers, graphics, and embedded/semi-custom chips. AMD operates in a large addressable market, covering areas such as PCs, servers, high-end gaming, and deep learning. Additionally, AMD has introduced competitive AI technologies, including powerful accelerators poised to capture a share in a market worth several hundred billion dollars. During the quarter, the company reported fiscal first-quarter operating results that met analyst estimates, with strengths in data center GPUs and server CPUs offsetting weaknesses in their gaming and embedded businesses. Moreover, management raised their fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance, albeit slightly below consensus estimates, where they expected double digit growth in data center revenues, while projecting a decline in their gaming segment, driven by weaknesses in both desktop GPUs and Semi-Custom Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC). While weaker-than-expected near-term results weighed on shares during the quarter, we believe the company is positioning itself to potentially benefit from long-term growth in AI infrastructure spending. Specifically, the company continues to gain server CPU market share, which could potentially accelerate as traditional compute deployments begin to recover.”

Overall AMD ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that will go to the moon. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

What To Expect in the Markets This Week,"Coming up: CPI inflation data, Apple product launch, earnings from GameStop, Oracle, Adobe

 David Paul Morris / Bloomberg / Getty Images

 The August report of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will give one last look at inflation before a key Federal Reserve meeting later this month. Wholesale pricing, consumer credit, and small business optimism are among the other economic data points scheduled for this week.


 Apple (AAPL) is expected to unveil its new AI-powered iPhone at a product launch event on Monday. Nvidia (NVDA), Walmart (WMT), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)  will participate in a Goldman Sachs (GS) technology event throughout the week. GameStop (GME) financials highlight the corporate earnings schedule this week, with Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) also reporting this week.

 The Wednesday release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) will give Federal Reserve officials one last data point on inflation before the Sept. 17-18 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 


 The July data showed that price increases stepped back to an annual rate of 2.9%. While the Fed is widely expected to begin cutting interest rates at the September meeting, changes in inflation data could influence the pace of the Fed’s future rate cut schedule. 


 Following the CPI data, market watchers will get insight into future inflation trends with the Thursday release of the wholesale-focused Producer Price Index (PPI).


 Apple will kick off the week with a product launch event on Monday, where it is expected to unveil the new iPhone 16 which includes artificial intelligence (AI) technology upgrades, and new versions of both the Apple Watch and AirPods. 


 Also on Monday, the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference begins, with Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su delivering remarks on the opening day. Other top tech and finance companies are also participating in the four-day event, including Cisco (CSCO) on Tuesday, Nvidia, and Walmart on Wednesday, and Snowflake (SNOW) on Thursday. 


 Video game retailer GameStop’s Tuesday report will highlight the earnings calendar for the week. Other tech earnings include Oracle, which reports on Monday, while Adobe’s report on Thursday will highlight whether the company has been able to capitalize on its AI product offerings. 


 Oxford Industries’ report on Wednesday will shine a light on sales of clothing brands like Tommy Bahama, Southern Tide and Lilly Pulitzer, while earnings from Designer Brands highlight footwear sales from Designer Shoe Warehouse, Keds and Hush Puppies. 


 Another noteworthy report comes Thursday from grocery store chain Kroger, which is currently fighting the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) efforts to block its proposed merger with rival Albertsons (ACI).

Apple Intelligence delays could impede iPhone 16 ‘supercycle’,"When Apple unveiled its AI plans at WWDC in June, analysts suggested the feature could put the iPhone 16 on track for another ""supercycle."" Like the addition of 5G before it, industry watchers believed that Apple Intelligence’s arrival might convince holdouts to bite the bullet and upgrade their device.

We’ll have a much better picture when the company reveals the iPhone 16 at tomorrow’s “It’s Glowtime” event in Cupertino. In the meantime, however, it's believed that Apple Intelligence's slow rollout could significantly hamper supercycle potential.

In June, Apple showed the world a take on AI firmly in-line with its mission statement of prioritizing user experience. Trained on small models -- instead of the massive black boxes behind services like Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT -- Apple’s play is centered around improving existing experiences through generative AI.

As Bloomberg notes today, however, delays could impact the iPhone 16's bottom line. WWDC offered a lot of big promises, but we’re unlikely to see many delivered until 2025. Regional limitations present key roadblocks as well, including in the EU and China -- the latter of which can make or break Apple financials in any given quarter. ChatGPT integration, meanwhile, is also unlikely for launch.

In the lead up to WWDC, the industry wondered whether Apple would be able to become a major player with the generative AI competition. But while the developer conference wowed observers with impressive demos, there’s still a lot of catching up to do.

At the time of writing, iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max are the only devices approved to run Apple Intelligence. Tomorrow’s event is set to change that, especially as further rumors point to increased uniformity across the iPhone 16 line. The base models are expected to get A18 chips, with the Pros, fittingly, getting an A18 Pros.

While sales are incredibly important to Apple and its shareholders, Apple Intelligence is a massive, multi-faceted undertaking, and rushing it out too early could have a longer term adverse impact on the company's bottom line than a staggered rollout.","When Apple unveiled its AI plans at WWDC in June, analysts suggested the
