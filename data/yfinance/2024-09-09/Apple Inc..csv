Apple Inc. (AAPL): Short Seller Sentiment Is Bullish,"We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other American tech stocks.

Tech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.

This dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.

Even though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.

Investors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.

According to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.

Looking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is ""healthy,"" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.

We sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

% of shares shorted: 0.80%               

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term leadership in the consumer electronics market by focusing on a high-end, closely connected ecosystem of products, services, and software. Apple's flagship iPhone is the central component of this ecosystem, accounting for 46% of the company’s net sales. Hence, providing it with pricing power, switching costs, and network impact. All other Apple products and services get the most value from keeping users within this walled garden. With this strategy, the company has growth potential and makes it unique.

The California-based tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence, an AI-powered personal system for its new smartphones, in fiscal Q3 2024, perhaps sparking an iPhone upgrade super cycle. Sales of iPhones reached $39.3 billion YoY, and Mac revenue increased 2% to $7 billion YoY, contributing to the company's $85.8 billion in revenue, a 5% YoY gain. AAPL's economic moat is bolstered by its solid financial history, which includes growth in net income and revenue over the last ten years.

Morningstar analysts upgraded their estimation of the company's fair value from $170 to $185 due to an improvement in their projection for iPhone revenue. Analysts predict strong iPhone-driven growth in 2025 and 2026, pushed by improvements to Apple's artificial intelligence technologies. However, they still believe the firm's stock is expensive, with the present price reflecting an unsustainable 20% iPhone revenue increase in fiscal 2025 amid headwinds in China and slowing upgrade cycles.

Baron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:

“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

Overall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Apple: Not Surprising That Berkshire Sold Half (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Marat Musabirov/iStock via Getty Images

Marat Musabirov/iStock via Getty Images

Always popular, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has received even more attention since Warren Buffett sold half of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A)/(BRK.B) stake this year. I've considered writing my own opinion of Apple for some time, but I could never quite find a good reason to do so. Buffett's move has intrigued me, and I decided to take another look myself.

I have dissected the investment opportunity that Buffett faced in 2016. I've done the same for Apple today. The contrast between these pictures explains why he reduced his stake. While Uncle Warren is our barometer of Apple, the deduction and interpretation is my own. Join me on this trip into his mind, and see why I consider AAPL a Hold.

A timeline of Buffett's AAPL trades shows his earliest position occurring in 2016. For the full-year results, AAPL accounted for 1.1% of the Berkshire portfolio at that time.

BRK 2016 Annual Report

BRK 2016 Annual Report

These initial trades, adjusted for the 4:1 stock split that occurred in 2020, came to a cost basis of $27.54 per share, with about $6.7B in capital committed. Buffett has been known for his avoidance of tech stocks throughout his life, and AAPL was one of those. Its IPO was in 1980, with a split-adjusted price of $0.10 per share! With more than three decades to invest in it, and some might think he ""missed out."" What finally convinced him to give AAPL a shot?

Let's look at the information he would have had. In the decade prior, Buffett would have observed impressive revenue growth for Apple, going from $19.3 billion in 2006 to $233.7B in 2015, more than 10x in just revenue! Not only that, but this revenue growth was not impeded by the Great Recession in 2008. Ben Graham taught value investing to Buffett as though another Great Depression could always happen, so this proved the strength of Apple's business model to him.

Of course, we want to see what happened with free cash flow as well, as we know Buffett would have been looking at that. Above, I have included the net outflows from M&A to give an adjusted FCF figure, but it's an impressive explosion of growth.

Market Cap History 2006 - 2015 (Seeking Alpha)

Market Cap History 2006 - 2015 (Seeking Alpha)

As these disclosures are for fiscal years ending September, we have to consider what picture Buffett would have been seeing in Berkshire's first quarter of 2016. AAPL ended calendar 2015 on a market cap of $587B, despite generating $69.7B in cash for that year and showing signs of growth. That's a multiple of about 8.4 for what was a rapidly growing business. Not only had that occurred, but something else had changed: They lost Steve Jobs in 2011.

In 2012, Buffett recalled how Jobs was opposed to buybacks, as he wanted to keep cash on hand for large acquisitions. Thus, Apple was not returning anything to shareholders through dividends or buybacks back then.

Author's display of 10-K data

Author's display of 10-K data

By 2016, Apple had been distributing dividends for four years and doing buybacks for three. With FCF per share growing from the business itself and the buybacks at low multiples, Buffett had exactly what he likes: free cash flow, growth, dividends, and undervalued buybacks.

2015 Revenue Breakdown (2015 Form 10-K)

As these cash flows were primarily driven from its strong iPhone product, supported by iPad and Mac sales with their cult followings, I think Buffett had reason to feel good about these cash flows going forward. Buybacks for undervalued stocks were essentially reinvesting into the same business for a higher return on capital, and Apple was now showing a preference for putting most of their FCF into that.

Berkshire would go on to acquire more shares after 2016 and build a much larger position, just over 900M shares. Based on what was reported in 2021 (pg. 7), the cost basis was no more than $33 per share.

As we entered 2024, Berkshire was sitting on about 905M shares of AAPL, almost half the market value of the stock portfolio.

AAPL 10Y Price History (Seeking Alpha)

AAPL 10Y Price History (Seeking Alpha)

Buffett had already sold 10M shares in Q4 2023 (a small portion), as AAPL had reached new highs. Some investors might do this to raise a little cash to take another position elsewhere. Still, it seems that Buffett was thinking harder about the whole position. In Q1, he sold about 116M shares, and this move was addressed by Buffett in the shareholder meeting.

Interestingly, most coverage on his remarks spoke to his wish to avoid higher taxes in the future. Yet, Buffett had opened those remarks by specifically stating that people focus too much on trying to avoid taxes. In hindsight, I see a warning that he intended to sell much more of AAPL in Q2, but not to worry about the tax impact. Q2 saw the sale of about 389M shares, leaving the current position at about 400M.

If we look at the past decade of Apple's financial results, differences become clear. Revenues have trended toward growth, but it's not an uninterrupted streak anymore. It's also not nearly as vertical as 2006-2015.

The same is true of the cash flows. On my adjusted basis, FCF is higher, but had some ebb and flow. Overall, the growth picture has not been as optimistic, but the long-term trend is still there, and cash flows don't turn negative.

Capex has remained very stable, even has Apple grows. Additions to Property, Plant, and Equipment peaked at $13.3B in 2018 and typically remains around $11B. M&A remained low and ceased after 2020. As of their Q3 Form 10-Q for this year, YTD figures remain comparable. Thus, I think Apple shows a very strong ability to scale, allowing for healthy FCF margins.

Revenue by Region (Q3 FY 2024 Form 10-Q)

Revenue by Region (Q3 FY 2024 Form 10-Q)

Revenue by region shows a similar story, with concentration in healthy economies such as those of the Americas and Europe and a footprint in Asia.

Revenue by Product (Q3 FY 2024 Form 10-Q)

Revenue by Product (Q3 FY 2024 Form 10-Q)

By product, the iPhone still dominates around half of revenues. Services is the one line that enjoys a much larger share of revenue than it did when Buffett first bought.

Apple's Services (Left: 2015 Form 10-K, Right: 2023 Form 10-K)

Apple's Services (Left: 2015 Form 10-K, Right: 2023 Form 10-K)

Apple was able to leverage and flesh out the ecosystem that was created once the iPhone experienced mass adoption. Not only were customers purchasing iPhones, but this converted to more revenue from the purchases in the App Store, the use of iCloud, and the emergence of their own advertising business.

2023 Form 10-K

2023 Form 10-K

Services also enjoy much better gross margins than their hard products. They are something of a stabilizer if iPhone sales are slower.

These mostly sound like good things, and yet Buffett still sold about half the position this year, while justifying it with his view that it's better to lock in a gain and pay the tax than worry too much about delaying a tax impact. In those same remarks, he even stated he thinks Apple is a wonderful business and worth keeping at least some stake. What could have motivated him to sell?

AAPL Market Cap 10Y History (Seeking Alpha)

AAPL Market Cap 10Y History (Seeking Alpha)

For one, let's consider where the market cap is now. Under $600B in 2016, it now stands over $3 trillion. While 2016's Price/FCF was about 8.4, today's is about 30.

Author's display of 10-K data

Author's display of 10-K data

As this multiple increased, so did the buybacks. While they greatly enhanced AAPL's growth of FCF per share when undervalued, they haven't abated. As the multiple expands, the return on capital for each buyback becomes less and less, perhaps even being value-deletive. With nearly all of FCF being devoted to buybacks now (and no one like Jobs to spit on the idea), the long-term returns of individual shares are in question.

30 is a high multiple, and very few businesses could be said to be undervalued when priced that way. Even ones with truly special products like Apple run into ceilings on growth when they become large enough, and Apple is the largest company in the world if measured by market cap. Measured by revenue, it's the seventh largest.

Smartphones and related devices have a cycle of use and replacement. S&P Global published an article, speaking to how higher interest rates have resulted in delays for device renewal. As almost nobody expects rate cuts to occur as quickly as hikes did, new sales of Apple devices could be strained for quite a while.

The one potential boon is the same as every tech stock: AI. As most of their revenue comes from selling devices, this would likely benefit their Services line. What doors will AI open for Apple that aren't already open? I find that hard to tell. Rather, I think AI just forces Apple to make sure that it can produce devices that run and work with AI well. Where Google (GOOG) and Palantir (PLTR) are software-driven and work with data, AI significantly magnifies the value their basic product can create. I don't see Apple being in nearly the same position, and perhaps Buffett agreed.

Based on all of this, I am going to value AAPL with a Discounted Cash Flow model. I'll make the following assumptions:

Assuming $100M in annual FCF (consistent with the last three years of the adjusted figure in my data), the current shares outstanding get us to $6.57 in FCF per share.

A CAGR of 10% for the next decade is what I believe to be the most optimistic, given how smartphones and related devices have already been widely adopted and higher interest rates may extend the cycle. Moreover, buybacks at these high prices could even slow the growth of FCF per share.

A terminal multiple of 15 is about half the current one and shows what can happen if the market contracts over time in response to slower growth. I suspect Apple's reputation is such that it's unlikely to be in the single digits again, however.

Author's calculation

Author's calculation

Priced for a 10% average return (typical of a market index), that suggests a fair value is about $164 per share, not far from where the price was while Buffett was selling. As I think this is optimistic, there's more room to disappoint. Apple just lacks the margin of safety that it had in 2016.

Possible DCF for Buffett

Possible DCF for Buffett

As Buffett is known to compare investments to the 10Y Note, it's possible he has even lower growth assumptions about Apple himself. With its rate around 4.5% in Q2, tweaking the DCF shows that Buffett may be expecting single-digit growth (if his other assumptions are similar to mine).

Apple is a solid company, but in recent years, sales and cash flows have grown but less steadily. Buybacks occur for nearly all of FCF and occur at multiples reaching 30 and offer less ability to magnify shareholder returns. They even risk weighing down the intrinsic value of the shares. The market of smart, electronic devices appears more saturated since their invention and prone to cycles of renewal. As one of the largest companies that exists, I think Apple is more likely to be affected by cycles going forward.

Are we getting a good price for AAPL by buying today? I don't think so. I think today's price may only be close to a fair value, depending on one's required rate of return. Buffett himself didn't squirm at the valuation to the point that he shed the entire position in Q2, but a sale of that magnitude highlights what his upper limits may be.

Given the difference in the mathematics between 2016 and today, it's not hard to see why, and that's why I think AAPL is in a Hold phase until the price or the value proposition change drastically.

Somewhere along the line we forgot how to value seven large companies. We knew they were better than almost all of the other companies out there. We knew that their managements were incredibly good and their prospects enormous. But looking back, we stopped caring at what price we bought these stocks and, instead, decided that they had to be owned no matter what, even if their valuations exceeded their normal bounds.

The problem, oddly, isn't that anyone got anything wrong. No, the problem is that even after this monster sell-off that we have been going through, we still can't figure out how to value them. So, let me give you my take on how this now disparate set of stocks became such a motley crew and what we can do about it.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other magic formula stocks.

One of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that’s also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.

Greenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund’s returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt’s fund delivered 50% in returns.

The hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you’ll understand if you study Warren Buffett’s investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it’s the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn’t disappointed, as his fund’s blazing run in the 1980s wasn’t its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.

However, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren’t as strong as the previous year’s performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn’t great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.

The next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund’s annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.

Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic’s immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt’s AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a ‘Magic Formula’ had lost its magic.

But you’d be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve’s rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.

However, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham’s pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.

Before we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it’s also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt’s strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm’s “pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.”

Our Methodology

To make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management’s Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.

For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Gotham Asset Management’s Q2 2024 Stake: $93.8 million

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology firm in the world. It is a global brand and generates 52% of its revenue through the iPhone. This allows Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a sizeable user base of 1.5 billion users as of 2023, which is its gold mine in the simplest of terms. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s closed ecosystem means that its users have to use the firm’s services, and it has used it to create a Services business that generates $78 billion in revenue annually. The user base is also the key to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s hypothesis, as the confidence in its ability to ensure that the users continue to upgrade their iPhones. It has also allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to emerge as a late winner in the AI race. Its shares have lost a mere 1.71% since July, which pales in comparison to MSFT’s 11.20% losses. This is because as opposed to MSFT, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is perceived to be in a better position to monetize AI due to its consumer focused business as opposed to the former’s enterprise focused model.

Baron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

Overall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

AI excitement isn't enough to make this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock a buy.

Tech giant Apple (AAPL -0.70%) has seen a nice run-up this year. Shares have risen more than 15% year to date as of this writing. Bidding up the stock in 2024, investors seem convinced the company could benefit from its innovations in artificial intelligence (AI).

While the iPhone maker might see a solid upgrade cycle for its new iPhones this year thanks to AI, this doesn't automatically make the stock a buy. Valuation matters, too -- and the stock's valuation is looking quite pricey. Of course, that doesn't necessarily make the stock a sell, either. Indeed, if I had to categorize the stock as either a buy, sell, or hold, I'd probably call it a hold.

There's no denying that Apple sets a high standard in business. On its approximately $386 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, for instance, the company generated an astounding $104 billion in free cash flow. This, combined with the company's war chest of cash ($153 billion at the end of its most recent quarter), enabled it to buy back an incredible $96 billion worth of its own stock over this same period. And this is on top of the $15.1 billion it spent on dividends. Extraordinary!

Powering these impressive financials is an integrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and services its customers love. Apple's loyal customer base means the company can charge high prices relative to its product costs, evidenced by its trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 46%.

Even more, while Apple's iPhone sales may be its bread and butter and its various products may be what the company is best known for, its services business is growing faster than its overall business and boasts a gross profit margin of 74%.

Driven primarily by App Store sales and subscriptions and the company's ever-expanding suite of native services, like Apple TV, AppleCare, iCloud storage, and Apple Pay, this lucrative segment will likely grow as a percentage of revenue over the long haul, making the company even more profitable. This segment will likely provide the tech company with an engine for sustainable long-term growth.

Despite all of these amazing facets of Apple's business, there are two reasons investors should be cautious about buying the stock today.

First, Apple isn't the fast-growing company it used to be. Total revenue rose 5% year over year in its most recent quarter. Sure, earnings per share rose 11% year over year with the help of margin expansion and share repurchases, but such low top-line growth is still a cause for concern.

Second, Apple stock's price-to-earnings ratio of about 34 today arguably already prices in strong growth for years to come. Even if the tech company continues growing its top line at current rates for the next decade, shareholder returns may be underwhelming at this valuation.

Still, given how great Apple's business is, shares are probably more of a hold than a sell today. After all, a quality business like this is probably more likely to surprise to the upside than the downside.
